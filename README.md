# MarsRoverGui

Gui for Cpr E 288: Introduction to Embedded Systems Final Project. The goal of the project was to get a modified roomba (Called the VORTEX platform) to navigate an obstacle course remotely. Creating Gui for the project was optional, however, I was up for the task and in the end it proved quite useful for navigating through the obstacle course. It even allowed for use to gain additional points by interfacing the gui using a video game controller.

This Gui is written in python. Tkinter was used for to create the graphical user interface portion and pyserial to communicate via serial interface to the bluetooth connected device.
